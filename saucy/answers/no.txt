Heellllllll no.
In your dreams.
Is water wet?
...no.
Of course... NOT!
YEET
No no no no no no no.
Absolutely not!!!!!!!!!!!
NO!
Not only no, but hell no.
Nope, your future is looking real bleak.
I would love to, but unfortunately...no.
It's N to the O!
I would love to say yes, but no.
Give me an 'N.' Give me an 'O.' Give me a NO!
No, absolutely not... are you crazy?
My answer is a resounding no!
You should rethink your idea.
Why, heavens no!
Oh, hell no!
I wasn't born for this.
I have a bad feeling about this, so no.
My parents said no.
No no no no no no no no no no no!
On a scale of maybe to absolutely, I would sayâ€”absolutely not!
In another life, perhaps?
I do not subscribe to that notion.
It's that time of the year when I usually always say no.
I'm going to have to flex my 'no' muscle on this one.
What's the opposite of yes?
How do you spell no?
Is the sun cold?
Would you take 'no' for an answer?
Ewwww...no!
You do know I hate you, right?
Not in a hundred years!
Not in a billion years!
NO! BE GONE THOT!
I would love to say yes, but my dog told me to say no.
The voices in my head are asking me to say 'no' to this one.
