OH WITHOUT A DOUBT MY GUY!
Most definitely!
Heck yeah friend!
Affirmative.
What a silly quesiton, of course!
Damn straight.
I would like to express my full approval.
That would be a Y-E-S!
Definitely not NO.
I do not disagree.
My answer is in the affirmative.
What's the opposite of no?
Are boogers salty?
Do pigeons fly?
I'll answer you with my favorite 'Y' wordâ€”Yes!
There's a 100% chance that I'm going say yes to that one.
I have examined your worthwhile view thoroughly. After close deliberation, I would say that I vehemently concur... yes.
I'm leaning towards yes, but what's in it for me?
Yes, my liege.
The answer is a resounding yes!
My enthusiastic nodding says it all.
Is the sun hot?
Why of course my dear friend :)
Absolutely, positively yes!!
Heck, you bet-cha, partner!
I might regret this, but YOLO! YES!
Certainly so.
By all means go for it.
Just be sure that we won't go to jail for this.
Abso-f*kin-lutely!
Probably yes, but I'll have my people call your people to discuss.
Even if I hate you, I would say yes to this one.
Yes, yes, and yes!
I love you, so yeah.
A million times, yes!
I give you my blessing.
I give you my seal of approval.
Do fishes swim?
yuh.
hell yeh.
